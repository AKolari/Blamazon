                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Blamazon is a small American online shipping company founded in Staten Island New York. You may be asking yourself
                        if we have any affiliation with any other tech company whose name rhymes with a large rainforest in South America. You would be
                        wrong for making this assumption. We have no affiliation with this company, as we do not need to, because we are better then them in 
                        every conceivable way.
                    </p>

            <div class="col-12 col-md-3">
                <div class="card bg-dark">
                    <h2>What We Do</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our bread and butter is putting things in boxes, and then bringing people these boxes. On occasion, we can 
                        put things in bags or even crates, but we find that to be a bit garish, and in many ways disrespectful to the art 
                        form that is putting things inside of boxes, and bringing them to people. You should try it. Putting things in boxes is 
                        good for the soul.

                    <h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
                    <p>
                       You may have seen in the news that the tech industry is experiencing a bit of a crisis right now, with many employees 
                       at large tech firms being laid off from their jobs. At Blamazon however, we are proud to say that we have not fired a 
                       single one of our employees. We consider ourselves an employee first company, and to us, mass layoffs are unconscionable. Now, 
                       you may bring up the fact that we have only one employee here at Blamazon, and say that our statement is disingenuous. To that we 
                       say, shame on you for discrediting a small American business simply on the bases of it's employee size. Shame.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Future</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using his ancient crystal ball, our CEO has predicted that within just six months, Blamazon will become a trillion dollar company,
                        and in just three short years, we will have overthrown the world's governemnts and turned Earth into an authoritarian Cyberpunk dystopia,
                        allowing us to harvest the Earth's resources so that we may build an advanced fleet of spacecraft, which we will use to make contact with 
                        alien civilizations and intergrate ourselves into wider galactic society. If you want to be a part of this future, then we strongly 
                        recommend you make an investment in our humble institution today.
